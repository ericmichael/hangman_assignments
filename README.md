# The Old Hangman Assignments

1. **Hangman TDD - Tests and Code**

This was a Blackboard assignment. Turn in your **hangmangame.dart** and your **hangmangame_test.dart** on Blackboard.




2. **Hangman Design**

Submit a link to your Figma design on Blackboard.



3. **Hangman Game - Practice**

Create a working hangman game using your code from the TDD assignment and the starter code on Github. *This was just for practice and is not due.*



# The New Hangman Assignments

## Intro

You work for GameRiot, Inc. GameRiot is a company that specializes in mobile games for iOS and Android. GameRiot has been in a slump for some time now. Small mobile games just aren't making as much money as they need to. To try to increase profits, Bob Stark (the CEO) has ordered each developer to try to come up with a small game that can be launched quickly, cheaply, & profitably. Mr. Stark is willing to take some losses if some games don't make any money. Mr. Stark, although he can be *sometimes cheap*, is huge on process, agile, and dev ops. He thinks that small groups of developers should be able to add to the companies bottom line (his wallet) by working smart and shipping quickly.



Rick Hernandez was a developer working at GameRiot. Hangman was his project. He was new to the company, fresh out of university. His experience was in C++, Java, algorithms, and machine learning. He also knew a little bit of web development. Mobile development was still pretty new to him so his developer friends at GameRiot were showing him the ropes. Rick was a good guy but he didn't always make the right choices. Getting a job as a programmer was always one of his dreams but his real passion was music. One day he received the call to tour with the Trans-Siberian Orchestra playing violin -- this was one of his bigger dreams. He had to take it and resigned immediately at GameRiot.



You have now inherited Rick's codebase. Rick was somewhat familiar with the right process although he made a lot of mistakes. He wasn't using version control from the beginning. When he finally checked in all his files, he did so to `master` --- and he forgot some. Some files are missing. Also although he has tests, not all of them pass.



Fortunately, Mr. Stark conveyed the importance of testing to all his employees and at least that stuck. All the tests are there but a few of them are failing due to missing files. Some tests are failing because the UI code was never finished.



This code base is what is considered **legacy code** because:

- it stills meets the customer's need but:
  - you didn't write it and it's poorly document or
  - you did write it, but a long time ago (and it's poorly documented) or
  - it lacks good tests (regardless of who wrote it)



In this case it is because you didn't write it and it's poorly documented.

One of the many benefits of testing is that is kind of *serves as documentation*. It tells us what the features are and what it is supposed to do. Fortunately for you, Rick did his best to properly test his code.



Our goal now is to take control of this project, bring it back to life, and make it a success.
